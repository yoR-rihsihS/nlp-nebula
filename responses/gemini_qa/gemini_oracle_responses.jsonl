Some governments have made efforts since the 1970s to reduce the release of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide into the atmosphere with positive results. Nitrogen oxides can also be produced naturally by lightning strikes, and sulfur dioxide is produced by volcanic eruptions.

Precipitation occurs when a portion of the atmosphere becomes saturated with water vapor, so that the water condenses and \"precipitates\". Thus, fog and mist are not precipitation but suspensions, because the water vapor does not condense sufficiently to precipitate. Two processes, possibly acting together, can lead to air becoming saturated: cooling the air or adding water vapor to the air.

Indian Ocean warming is the largest among the tropical oceans, and about 3 times faster than the warming observed in the Pacific.

The Indian Ocean is located in the tropics, which means that it receives a lot of sunlight. This sunlight heats the ocean water, making it warmer than the water in other oceans. The Indian Ocean is also the third largest ocean in the world, which means that it has a lot of water to heat up. Finally, the circulation patterns in the Indian Ocean help to keep the water warm. The currents in the Indian Ocean flow in a clockwise direction, which helps to trap the heat in the ocean.", "model": "gemini-pro", "correct_answer": ["human induced greenhouse warming"]}

This was the first time it was suggested that an individual develops from a (single) nucleated cell. This was in contradiction to Ernst Haeckel's theory that the complete phylogeny of a species would be repeated during embryonic development, including generation of the first nucleated cell from a \"monerula\", a structureless mass of primordial mucus (\"Urschleim\"). Therefore, the necessity of the sperm nucleus for fertilization was discussed for quite some time. However, Hertwig confirmed his observation in other animal groups, including amphibians and molluscs. Eduard Strasburger produced the same results for plants in 1884. This paved the way to assign the nucleus an important role in heredity. In 1873, August Weismann postulated the equivalence of the maternal and paternal germ cells for heredity. The function of the nucleus as carrier of genetic information became clear only later, after mitosis was discovered and the Mendelian rules were rediscovered at the beginning of the 20th century; the chromosome theory of heredity was therefore developed.\n\n\nQuestion: what is the center of heredity in a cell\nAnswer:", "model_answer": "The nucleus", "model": "gemini-pro", "correct_answer": ["nucleus", "Cell nuclei", "the nucleus", "chromosome"]}

{"model_prompt": "Write a high-quality answer for the given question using only the provided search results (some of which might be irrelevant).\n\nDocument [1](Title: Miller Lite) Miller Lite was essentially the first mainstream light beer. After its first inception as \"Gablinger's Diet Beer,\" developed in 1967 by Joseph L. Owades, PhD, a biochemist working for New York's Rheingold Brewery, the recipe was given by Owades to Chicago's Peter Hand Brewing. That year, Peter Hand Brewing was purchased by a group of investors, renamed Meister Brau Brewing, and Lite was soon introduced as Meister Brau Lite, a companion to their flagship Meister Brau. Under the new management, Meister Brau Brewing encountered significant financial problems, and in 1972, sold several of its existing labels to Miller. The recipe was relaunched simply as \"Lite\" on packaging and in advertising (with \"Lite Beer from Miller\" being its \"official\" name until the late '90s) in the test markets of Springfield, Illinois, Knoxville, Tennessee, and San Diego, California, in 1973, and heavily marketed using masculine pro sports players and other, so-called, macho figures of the day in an effort to sell to the key beer-drinking male demographic. Miller Lite was introduced nationally in 1975. Miller's heavy-advertising approach worked where the two previous light beers had failed, and Miller's early production totals of 12.8 million barrels quickly increased to 24.2 million barrels by 1977 as Miller rose to 2nd place in the American brewing marketplace. Other brewers responded, in particular Anheuser-Busch with its heavily advertised Bud Light in 1982, which eventually overtook Lite in sales by 1994. Anheuser-Busch played on the branding style of \"Lite\" by highlighting the fact that their beer was called \"Bud Light,\" as \"everything else is just a light.\" In 1992, light beers became the biggest domestic beer in America, and in 1998, Miller relabeled its \"Lite\" brand as \"Miller Lite.\"\n\nQuestion: what was the first light beer in the us\nAnswer:", "model_answer": "Miller Lite", "model": "gemini-pro", "correct_answer": ["Miller Lite"]}

God gave Sarai the new name \"Sarah\", and blessed her. Abraham was given assurance that Sarah would have a son. Not long afterwards, Abraham and Sarah were visited by three men. One of the visitors told Abraham that upon his return next year, Sarah would have a son. While at the tent entrance, Sarah overheard what was said, and she laughed to herself about the prospect of having a child at their ages. The visitor inquired of Abraham why Sarah laughed at the idea of bearing a child, for her age was as nothing to God. Sarah soon became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham, at the very time which had been spoken. The patriarch, then a hundred years old, named the child \"Isaac\" (Hebrew yitschaq, \"laughter\") and circumcised him when he was eight days old. For Sarah, the thought of giving birth and nursing a child, at such an old age, also brought her much laughter, as she declared, \"God had made me to laugh, [so that] all that hear will laugh with me.\" Abraham held a great feast on the day when Isaac was to be weaned. It was during this banquet that Sarah happened upon the then teenaged Ishmael mocking and was so disturbed that she requested that both he and Hagar be removed from their company.

On Earth, gravity gives weight to physical objects, and the Moon's gravity causes the ocean tides. The gravitational attraction of the original gaseous matter present in the Universe caused it to begin coalescing, forming stars\u00a0\u2013 and for the stars to group together into galaxies\u00a0\u2013 so gravity is responsible for many of the large scale structures in the Universe.

This is only partly true; Dallas had in fact decided to host games on Thanksgiving by their own decision because there was nothing else to do or watch on that day. In 1975 and 1977, at the behest of then-Commissioner Pete Rozelle, the St. Louis Cardinals replaced Dallas as a host team (Dallas then hosted St. Louis in 1976). Although the Cardinals, at the time known as the \"Cardiac Cards\" due to their propensity for winning very close games, were a modest success at the time, they were nowhere near as popular nationwide as the Cowboys, who were regular Super Bowl contenders during this era. This, combined with St. Louis's consistently weak attendance, a series of ugly Cardinals losses in the three-game stretch, and opposition from the Kirkwood\u2013Webster Groves Turkey Day Game (a local high school football contest) led to Dallas resuming regular hosting duties in 1978; it was then, after Rozelle asked Dallas to resume hosting Thanksgiving games, that the Cowboys requested (and received) an agreement guaranteeing the Cowboys a spot on Thanksgiving Day forever.\n\nQuestion: when did the cowboys start playing on thanksgiving day\nAnswer:", "model_answer": "1966", "model": "gemini-pro", "correct_answer": ["In 1966", "1966", "1978"]}
